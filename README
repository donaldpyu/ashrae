I'm following this guide:
https://leocode.com/development/automation-with-selenium-and-python-for-beginners/

It doesn't really work because you need to download a specific Chrome driver because the latest version of Chrome
is not compatible with Selenium.

# C:\Users\donal\PycharmProjects\ashrae\chromedriver.exe
# E       selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 114
# E       Current browser version is 123.0.6312.86 with binary path C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe

Need to scrape: https://ashrae-meteo.info/v2.0/places.php?continent=North%20America

I need to get 2021 data of each of the stations per continent

The list of stations you get get a query like: ?lat=53.113&lng=-111.181&place=%27%27&wmo=710050

then i need to get Extreme Annual Design Conditions > n-Year Return Period Values of Extreme Temperature
n=5, 10, 20, 50 year max values from that table.

So the table fields will look like:

year, continent, country, weather_station_name, long, lat, max5, max10, max20, max50
